Reversed code for 0x80037C0 CopyRoomDataToScreen(room *datapointer, int memstart)
This code is used to decompress bg maps, gfx, and sprites to vram. It's called 4-5 times per frame, if not more but at least that many per layer.
GBA valid decompression code grabbed from some emulators, it was late at night when I did this so i'm not sure where the credit is due, I think it was either rascalboy or vba.
